                "description": "The surveillance footage captures the interior of a public bus from a high-angle camera positioned at the rear. The scene is illuminated by the bus's interior lights, indicating it is nighttime. The bus appears to be mostly empty, with rows of vacant seats visible. A single, indistinct figure is standing in the aisle near the front entrance. The critical event in this sequence is a sudden and extremely bright flash of white and yellow light originating from the very front of the bus, possibly near the driver's area or the front door. This light is so intense that it washes out the camera sensor, obscuring details and suggesting a high-energy event such as an explosion, electrical arc, or fire.",
