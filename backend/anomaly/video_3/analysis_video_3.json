The chronological sequence of events in the rear of a nearly empty bus begins with a passenger bending over and interacting with an object on the floor before moving downwards. This is followed by the same passenger removing an upper garment and moving towards the back. The analysis concludes with the individual, initially unseen, rising from the floor/seat area and again bending down towards an object on the floor, collectively suggesting a pattern of covert and unusual activity."
